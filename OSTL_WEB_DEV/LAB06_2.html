    <p>
        <strong> Pollution</strong> is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.<br> These harmful materials are called <mark>pollutants</mark>.<br> Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash.<br> They can also be created by human
        activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.<br> Many things that are useful to people produce pollution.<br> Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes.<br> Burning coal to
        create electricity pollutes the air.<br><mark> Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water.</mark><br> Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.<br><b> All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of air and water.</b><br>        When these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.<br><b> Pollution is a global problem.</b><br> Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside, <i>pollution can spread to remote places where no people live.<br> For example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet.</i>        In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.<br><br><br>

        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        Sometimes, air pollution is visible.<br> A person can see dark smoke pour from the exhaust pipes of large trucks or factories, for example. More often, however, air pollution is invisible.<br> Polluted air can be dangerous, even if the pollutants
        are invisible.<br> It can make people’s eyes burn and make them have difficulty breathing. <br>It can also increase the risk of lung cancer.<br> Sometimes, air pollution kills quickly. <br>In 1984, an accident at a pesticide plant in <b>Bhopal, India,</b>        released a deadly gas into the air.<br> At least 8,000 people died within days.<br> <mark>Hundreds of thousands more were permanently injured.</mark><br>

        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <b>S</b>ome polluted water looks muddy, smells bad, and has garbage floating in it.<br> Some polluted water looks clean, but is filled with harmful chemicals you can’t see or smell.<br> Polluted water is unsafe for drinking and swimming.<br>Some
        people who drink polluted water are exposed to hazardous chemicals that may make them sick years later.Others consume bacteria and other tiny aquatic organisms that cause disease.<br> <mark>The <b>United Nations</b> estimates that 4,000 children die every day from drinking dirty water.</mark><br>
